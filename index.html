                <p><b>Can anyone apply?</b></p>
                <p>Yes – no credentials required.</p>

                <p><b>What type of writing or project qualifies?</b></p>
                <p>
                        Anything that focuses on producing long-format
                        writing content that can be traditionally or
                        digitally published. It can be comics, novels,
                        historical or literary fiction and everything
                        else in-between.
                </p>

                <p><b>Wait, is this a grant or an investment?</b></p>
                <p>
                        This is an investment, not a grant. In exchange for the $10,000 
                        funding, we offer writers the choice of either:
                </p>
                <ul>
                        <li>15% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment">revenue share</a> 
                            from all future book sales and related income, or</li>
                        <li>5% <a href="https://capital.com/equity-stake-definition">equity stake</a> 
                            in the writer's publishing business or intellectual property rights</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>How will you select the winners?</b></p>
                <p>
                        We're looking for smart and energetic people
                        with fun and interesting ideas.
                        Drafts are a big plus; not just because they're
                        great to read through, but because they hint at
                        the type of person that cares about the reader's
                        experience, which is ultimately all that
                        matters.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>Yes.</p>

                <p><b>Who is funding this?</b></p>
                <p>
